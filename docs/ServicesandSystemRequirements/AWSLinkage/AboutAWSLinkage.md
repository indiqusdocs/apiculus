# About AWS Linkage

Apiculus aims at offering a multicloud experience to service providers as well as end customers/subscribers. This broadly covers the following aspects:

- **Billing consolidation** - the ability for service providers to present a single, consolidated invoice to their customers for AWS usage, that is, own cloud and public cloud(s).
- **Self-service for end customers** - the ability for end customers to provision, list and manage EC2 instances directly from the Apiculus UI.
- **Reseller benefits** - the ability for service providers to pass reseller benefits to the end customers (subject to service provider having the required partner credentials with AWS).
