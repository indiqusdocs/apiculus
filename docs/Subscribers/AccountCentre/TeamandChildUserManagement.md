# Team and Child User Management

Team members or child users can be onboarded using the **TEAM** section from the Account Centre. Apiculus Cloud allows you to add billing, technical, or other admin users who can log in to your account and perform operations.

To add a child user, click the **+INVITE TEAM MEMBERS** button on the top right. This will open up a dialog box with the following information requirements:

- **User Details -** name, email, country, phone number, etc., for the child user.
- **Password -** set a strong password to begin with. 
  :::note
   The child user can reset the password from the Apiculus Cloud Console.
  :::
- **Group -** the role of the child user. These can be:
    - **Admin -** gets access to all functionalities.
    - **Billing -** gets permissions to perform billing actions and read-only for other actions.
    - **Technical -** gets permissions to perform technical actions and read-only for other actions.

The child user receives an email notification when their account is created. They can then login and use the **Apiculus Cloud Console** based on their assigned role.

:::note
The first/default user will supersede all other admin users, which means that while admin users can edit or remove other users, only the default user can delete other admin users.
