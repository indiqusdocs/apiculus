# Unbilled Charges
All subscriptions incur prorated charges during an accountâ€™s billing cycle. These charges, also known as unbilled charges, can be accessed from **Billing > Unbilled Charges** in the main navigation panel.

- Unbilled charges for fixed subscriptions (recurring or non-recurring) are prorated daily by default.
- Unbilled charges for **usage-based subscriptions** reflect the actual charges incurred up to the last hour.
