# Volume Management with RHEL Instances

To view the disks attached to particular Instance, Navigate to a [RHEL Instances](AboutRHELInstances.md) and access the **Volumes** tab.
RHEL Instances on Apiculus work with the [Block Volumes Service](/docs/Subscribers/Storage/BlockVolumes/AboutBlockVolumes) and let you carry out basic disk operations.
