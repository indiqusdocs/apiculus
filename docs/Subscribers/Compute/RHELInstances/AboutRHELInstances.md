# About RHEL Instances

Instances are computing units that provide you with resources to run your applications/workloads. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Instances are virtual machines that run the images of RHEL Operating System.

The Apiculus platform offers a flexible and granular pricing model for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) based on virtual CPU (vCPU) core slabs. This model allows organizations to tailor costs to their actual resource usage, making it a versatile option for businesses with varying workload demands.

Apiculus provides tiered pricing for RHEL by supporting the following core categories:

- **1-8 vCPUs**: This slab is suitable for small to medium workloads, typically found in lightweight applications, development environments, and smaller production workloads. Pricing in this range is designed to be competitive, allowing users to optimize costs for modest resource requirements.
    
- **9-128 vCPUs**: This middle tier accommodates larger workloads, such as those seen in extensive application environments, data processing, and medium-to-large production systems. Pricing for this range is aligned with Red Hat's standard, making it easier to manage costs as applications scale up.
    
- **129+ vCPUs**: Designed for enterprise-grade deployments, this category caters to highly intensive applications requiring significant compute resources. These could include data analytics, machine learning workloads, and large-scale production systems. Apiculus ensures that pricing is optimized for businesses managing large virtualized environments with high vCPU demands.
    

Each slab follows Red Hat's established core model, ensuring transparent and predictable pricing while offering the flexibility to manage resources effectively. By aligning with Red Hat's structure, Apiculus makes it easier for businesses to plan costs accurately as they scale across different workload sizes.
