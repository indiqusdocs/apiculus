# Viewing RHEL Instances

Before creating an RHEL instance, it is important to plan the architecture, networking and access to the RHEL Instances.

Apiculus offers a highly usable and visual way of working with and operating RHEL Instances using the Cloud Console. All RHEL Instances available in your account can be accessed in the following way:

1. Navigate to **Compute > RHEL Instances**.
2. All the RHEL instances for your account are listed here with the following details:
	- Instance Name and the configuration details
	- OS Icon
	- Default IP Address
	- IPv6 Address
	- Created

Below the Instance name, there is an informational view where you can find the following details:
- Configuration
- Availability Zone
- Default IP
- Created 

On the top right corner, two quick options are available, one to **Launch Console** and the other to **POWER OFF/ON** the Instance.
