# RHEL Instance Operations

Navigate to a [RHEL Instances](AboutRHELInstances.md) and access the **Operations** tab to see all available Instance operations.

Apiculus CloudConsole provides the options to perform common operations on RHEL Instances.

- **Restart Instance** - Use this option to perform a quick reboot on your Instance. This is a simple restart, and no data will be lost.
- **Force Stop Instance** - to forcefully stop a running or a hung RHEL Instance.
- **Reset Password**- to reset the RHEL Instances root user password. This requires the RHEL Instance to be powered off.
- **Reset SSH Key** - to (re)set the RHEL Instances SSH key association. This requires the RHEL Instance to be powered off.
- **Rename Instance** - to rename the RHEL Instance.
- **Migrate Network** - to migrate RHEL Instance between VPC networks within the same Availability Zone.
- **Reinstall Instance** - to restore this Instance to its original configuration by reinstalling its Operating System or choosing a new one. Choosing a new Operating System image may have an additional billing component if it's a priced Operating System.
- **Delete Instance** - to delete the RHEL Instance. Please note that deleting a RHEL Instance will remove it entirely along with its subscription and is a non-reversible action.
