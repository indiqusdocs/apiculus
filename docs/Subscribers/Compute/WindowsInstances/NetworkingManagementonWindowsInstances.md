# Networking Management on Windows Instances

To view the networks that a particular Instance is attached to, navigate to the [Windows Instances Screen](AboutWindowsInstances), select a Windows Instance, and access the **Networking** tab.

The following actions are available:

- If the Instance is inside a VPC, you can associate it with multiple tiers within the VPC or share it with other VPC networks in the same Availability Zone by using the **ADD NETWORK** option.
- Network/tier associations can be removed from this section by using the unlink action.

:::note
Advanced networking configurations can be done using the Virtual Private Cloud service.
