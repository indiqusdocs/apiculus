To view all available Instance operations, navigate to the [Windows Instances Screen](AboutWindowsInstances), select a Windows Instance, and access the **Operations** tab.

Yntraa cloud console provides the options to perform common operations on Windows Instances.

- **Migrate Instance** - to migrate Windows Instance between VPC networks within the same Availability Zone.
- **Reinstall Instance** - to restore this Instance to its original configuration by reinstalling its Operating System or choosing a new one. Selecting a priced Operating System image may incur additional charges.
- **Delete Instance** - to delete the Windows Instance.
