# Working with Windows Instance Snapshots

To view all the snapshots taken for the Instance, navigate to the [Operating Windows Instances](AboutWindowsInstances), select a Windows Instance and access the **Snapshots** tab.

Instance Snapshots allow you to create point-in-time images of Instances that preserve all their data volume as well as (optionally) their CPU/memory states. You can use Snapshots to quickly restore Instances.

The Snapshots section shows all Windows Instances snapshots, which can be used to revert the Windows Instances to an earlier state.

Snapshot will list down the following details:
- Snapshot Name
- Description
- Internal Name
- Type
- Created On
 
Two quick options are available, one is to revert the Instance from the snapshot, and the other is to delete the particular snapshot.

- To create a snapshot, click on the **CREATE SNAPSHOT** button.
- It will ask you for the name of the snapshot and the description of the snapshot.
- Click on create, the snapshot will be created, and if you click on cancel, the action will be canceled.
