Instances are computing units that provide you with resources to run your applications/workloads. Windows Instances are virtual machines that run the images of Windows Operating Systems.

2. All the Windows Instances for your account will be listed here with the following details:
    - Instance Name (Along with the configuration details)
    - OS- Icon

 To view a list of sections and the various operations or actions, click **Instance name**. Below the Instance name, there is an informational view where you can find the below details:
