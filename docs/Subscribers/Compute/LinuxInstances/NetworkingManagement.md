# Networking Management

To view the networks of particular Instance, navigate to [Operating Linux Instances](AboutLinuxInstances.md), select a Linux Instance and access the **Networking** tab.

The following actions are available:

- If the Instance is inside a VPC, you can associate the Instance to multiple tiers within the VPC or share the Instance with other VPC networks in the same Availability Zone by using the **ADD NETWORK** option.
- Network/tier associations can be removed from this section by using the **unlink** action.

:::note
Advanced networking configurations can be done using the Virtual Private Clouds service.
