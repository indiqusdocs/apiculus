# Working with Linux Instance Snapshots

 To view all the Snapshots taken for Instance, navigate to the [Operating Linux Instances](AboutLinuxInstances.md), select a Linux Instance and access the **Snapshots** tab.

Instance Snapshots allow you to create point-in-time images of instances that preserve all their data volume as well as (optionally) their CPU/memory states. You can use Snapshots to quickly restore Instances.

The Snapshots section shows all the Linux Instance Snapshots, which can be used to revert the Linux Instances to an earlier state.
