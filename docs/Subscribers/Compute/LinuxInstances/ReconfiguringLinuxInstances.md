:::note
You can only reconfigure with the same billing interval. To change the billing interval, use the **Switch Plan** button. It is recommended to switch the plan before reconfiguring the Instance if you wish to use both the Reconfigure and Switch Plan options. You will be charged as per the pack you have reconfigured, not based on the older pack.
