    "description": "The L2 Networks module includes adding Layer 2 (L2) networks in your cloud setup. They are needed in a cloud environment when virtual machines need to communicate directly with each other on the same network, just like they would in a traditional data center. They help run older applications that expect local network connections. It also gives more control over devices that connect and share data, making the cloud more adaptable for different types of workloads."
