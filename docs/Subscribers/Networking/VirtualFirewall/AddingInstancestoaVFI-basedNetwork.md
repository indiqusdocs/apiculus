# Adding Instances to a VFI-based Network

Instances can be created and placed in the L2-LAN (Free Networks) created by the Virtual Firewall. These Instances use special Linux OS images, which are available as a separate OS Collection. Users can create [Linux Instances](/docs/Subscribers/Compute/LinuxInstances/AboutLinuxInstances), and choose the appropriate options/controls to create an Instance in the Virtual Firewall network.
