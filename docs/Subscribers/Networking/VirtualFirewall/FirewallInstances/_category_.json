    "description": "The Firewall Instance module describes how users can create and manage virtual firewalls using specialized Linux or Windows images, thereby protecting network traffic in the cloud. It includes easy-to-understand graphs to monitor activity, tools to manage storage (volumes), and alerts to warn about security issues or unusual behavior. This makes it easy to keep your cloud network secure, organized, and running smoothly all from one place in Apiculus. The module also explains how to use snapshots for quick restoration of the Virtual Firewall and covers network management features for connecting the Virtual Firewall to associated private networks. Additionally, it provides guidance on reconfiguring the Virtual Firewall and includes basic operations such as restart, force stop, delete, and rename."
