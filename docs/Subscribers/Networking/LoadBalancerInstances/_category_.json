    "description": "A Load Balancer instance (LBI) is a virtual device in the cloud that allocates incoming network traffic across multiple servers. It makes sure that no single server gets too many requests, which helps keep applications running smoothly and fast. The LBI service allows Cloud Console users to create load balancer appliances, which are Linux Instances pre-loaded with a Citrix NetScaler VPX image.If you don't have a load balancer, the server will become too busy, resulting in slow response or errors."
