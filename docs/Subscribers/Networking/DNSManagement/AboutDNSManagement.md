# About DNS Management

Apiculus servers can be used as authoritative name server(s) for managing DNS records. If the Service is enabled, Cloud Console users can bring their own domains (BYOD) to use with the workloads created using Apiculus-powered clouds.

The following sections outline how to use this service:

- [Bringing your domains to Apiculus Cloud Console](LinkingDomainstoApiculusCloudConsole.md)
- [Managing DNS records using Apiculus Cloud Console](ManagingDNSRecords.md)
- [Switching (back) to another DNS provider](SwitchingtoAnotherDNSProvider.md)
