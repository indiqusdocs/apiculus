# About NAT Gateways

A Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway is a networking component in cloud and on-premises environments that enables resources within a private subnet (such as virtual machines or containers) to connect to the internet or other external networks, without exposing these resources directly to incoming connections from those external networks. This helps in enhancing security in cloud infrastructure by keeping resources in private subnets isolated from direct public access.
