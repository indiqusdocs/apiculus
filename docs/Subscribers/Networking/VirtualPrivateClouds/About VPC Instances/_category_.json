    "description": "A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a software-defined networking capability on Apiculus that allows cloud users to simulate a traditional private cloud environment on a public cloud. Using VPC, users can control a host of features and configurations including subnet/tier management, access control using ACL, NAT-ing using IPv4, managing site-to-site or remote VPN connections, or in some advanced cases, terminating their MPLS connections directly on the VPC.

On Apiculus, VPC is delivered using a virtual router (VR).
