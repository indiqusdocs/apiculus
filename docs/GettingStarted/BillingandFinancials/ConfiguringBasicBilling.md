# Configuring Basic Billing

Service providers can easily set up key billing settings to manage invoice generation and credit terms for subscriber accounts.
- **Invoice Number Prefix** - All the invoices will be generated with this specified prefix. Changing the prefix here will not apply to the already generated invoices; this will apply to the newer invoices.
- **Default Credit Limit** - This is the credit limit that will be assigned to all the self-signed up subscriber accounts.
- **Default Credit Period** - This is the default credit period that will apply to all self-signed up subscriber accounts.
