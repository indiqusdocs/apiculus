- **Account ID Prefix** - You can specify the prefix for the accounts. By default, all account IDs will start with this defined prefix.
- **Admin Approval Required** - If this switch is on, it means that all account signup requests will show up as draft accounts and will be published only after admin approval.
- **Admin Only Signups** - If this is enabled, it means the self-signup form will be disabled and only admins will be able to create the subscriber accounts.
- **Send Emails to Admins & Account Managers** - If this option is selected, an email will be sent to admins and account managers whenever signup for a new account happens.
- **Send Emails to Other IDs** - If this option is selected, all the specified email IDss will receive an email whenever a new account signup happens.
