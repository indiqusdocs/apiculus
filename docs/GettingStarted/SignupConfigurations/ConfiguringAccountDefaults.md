# Configuring Account Defaults

Account defaults include the various configurations that are applied once an account is created successfully. For example, you can mandate the KYC for organisation and individual accounts, or profile information must be complete before an individual or organisation purchases from the marketplace.

To configure account defaults, navigate to **Administration** > **Settings** > **Account Defaults**. The following screen appears:
