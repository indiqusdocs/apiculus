# Maintaining Relationship Personnel Information

The Apiculus Cloud Console enables users to easily view information on designated relationship personnel, as specified by the service providers. Using the Admin Console, service providers can keep this information updated for each subscriber account.

Apiculus allows maintaining primary and secondary personnel details and both can be accessed by navigating to the target account and selecting the **Relationship Personnel** sub-section.

This information will be visible to subscribers in their Account Centre.
