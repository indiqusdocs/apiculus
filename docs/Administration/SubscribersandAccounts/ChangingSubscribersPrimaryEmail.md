## Steps for Changing the Primary Email
1. Navigate to **Account Management** > **Select Account**> **Edit Account**.
2. Under the **Details** section, click on the **Change Primary Email** button.

Admins can cancel this process by clicking the **Cancel Verification** link. This will cancel the email change process. Admin can also resend the verification link by clicking **Resend Link**.

The subscribers need to click the **link** or the **Confirm** button received in the new email ID and enter the **verification code** received in the email.

Once the email is successfully updated, end-users will be able to log in to the platform using the updated email ID and their existing password.

:::note
Once the primary email change is completed, an email will be sent to both the new and old email addresses.
