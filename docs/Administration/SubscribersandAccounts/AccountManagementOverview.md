# Account Management Overview

Apiculus allows service providers to manage their subscriber/customer life cycles end to end. Subscriber account is one of the key entities that the entire solution is designed for. While Apiculus supports many features that impact the subscriber life cycles, this section focuses only on actions that can be performed within the **Accounts** section of the Apiculus service provider admin panel.
## Viewing Subscriber Accounts
All subscriber accounts can be viewed as a list by navigating to **Accounts > Account Management**.
