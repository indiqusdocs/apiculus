# Adding One-time Charges and Discounts

Administrators can add charges and discounts manually as one-time subscriptions. It is beneficial for the use cases; if the invoice is generated and some discount or charge needs to be recorded for a customer, then admins can do the same. This is an excellent boost to billing-related workflows.

## From Global Subscriptions

Admins need to perform the following steps on the admin portal to add charges and discounts from the global subscriptions section.

1. Navigate to **Billing & Financial** > **Subscription** > **+ADD ONE TIME CHARGE**.
2. Enter the following details:
    - **Name** 
    - **Description**
    - **Select Charge Type** (Charge or discount)
    - **Enter the amount**
    - **Select a customer from the list of accounts**
3. Click on **add**.
