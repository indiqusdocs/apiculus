# Reversing Transactions

Transactions and payments, once received and recorded, can not be edited. In case of refunds or cancellations, a 'reverse' entry needs to be made in the accounting books. All online and offline transactions (with the exception of credit notes) can be reversed by clicking on the _reverse_ icon in an account-level or global transactions listing, or by clicking on the **Reverse** action while [viewing transaction details](ViewingTransactionDetails).

:::note 
Reverse transactions show in red colour in the transactions listing and carry a negative (-) amount. All recorded [transactions are visible to subscribers/customers](/docs/Subscribers/AccountCentre/WalletandTransactions) in their Account Centre.
