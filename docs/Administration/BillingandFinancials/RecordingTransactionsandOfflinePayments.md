# Recording Transactions and Offline Payments

Payments received outside the Apiculus system can be recorded as Transactions using the Apiculus admin console. These payments may be against invoices that are open or may be 'advance' payments that adjust against invoices generated in future.

Transactions can be recorded at the account level or from global section of the admin console.
## Recording Single Transactions

You can record single transactions at the account level by navigating into the target customer account and clicking the **+ Add Transaction** link in the **Transactions** section/tab.![Transaction](img/Transaction3.png)

This will list all open invoices (fully open and partially open) and allow for specifying the transaction amount, date, mode, reference, narration, and information on apportioning the amount between all open invoices. Any remainder amount that is not apportioned against an invoice will be recorded as an advance, and will reflect in the next invoice.

Click on **Add Transaction** and enter the required details.

Bulk upload allows recording transactions for multiple customers against multiple invoices at once. Bulk transactions can be recorded using the spreadsheet template available (as .ods and .xlsx).

 1. Navigate to **Billing and Financials > Transactions** section. ![Transaction](img/Transaction1.png)
 2. Click on **+ Add Payments** in the global list of transactions. ![Transaction](img/Transaction2.png)
