# Recording Tax Deductions

You can configure tax deductions via a new section under Settings called Tax Deductions. This involves taxes deducted by the customers while making a payment and is different from taxation on services which involves taxes charged on the services delivered. Admins can record quarterly tax deductions for all customer invoices. The Tax Deductions section lists all such tax deductions and also allows for adding new items. The Tax Deductions feature is optional and needs to be enabled from the global settings, where admins also get the ability to define their country’s fiscal period and fiscal quarters.
