## Editing Enrollment Options

Admins have various options to edit enrolled accounts like end trial now, end with billing cycle, end on custom date, end with the previous month, cancel trial etc.

- **End Trial Now** - This will un-enroll the account from the trial immediately and retain the benefits accumulated till now.
- **End with Billing Cycle** - This will keep the account enrolled till the end of the current billing cycle and not carry the enrollment into the next billing cycle.
- **End on Custom Date** - This will un-enroll the account from the trial on a specified date in the future.
- **Change Dates** - This can be used to edit the trial start and end dates.
- **End with Previous Month** - This option can be used if the account needs to be un-enrolled in the current billing cycle.
- **Cancel Trial** - This will remove the account from the trial and remove any accumulated benefits.

:::note
None of the above options will have any impact on benefits that have been applied and invoiced in previous months.
