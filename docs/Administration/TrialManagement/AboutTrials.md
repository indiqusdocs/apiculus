# About Trials

Apiculus offers two options for managing trial programmes, giving users the flexibility to choose how they want to experience the platform:
- [Account Trials ](#account-trials)
- [Subscription Trials](#subscription-trials)

Trial programmes are set with a defined duration (in days) and a benefit (in percentage discount). Any billing amounts generated within the specified duration will include the benefit, and this will be reflected on the next invoice.

:::note
Trial benefits for the billing cycle will be displayed on the invoice if the subscriber is enrolled in any trial programme.

## Account Trials
[Account trials](WorkingwithAccountTrials) apply to ALL billing amounts generated for an account during the trial enrollment. The Apiculus billing system automatically manages billing records for trial enrollments that span multiple billing cycles, i.e., months.

## Subscription Trials
[Subscription trials](WorkingwithSubscriptionTrials) apply to ALL billing amounts generated for individual subscriptions during the trial enrollment. The Apiculus billing system automatically manages billing records for trial enrollments that span multiple billing cycles, i.e., months.
