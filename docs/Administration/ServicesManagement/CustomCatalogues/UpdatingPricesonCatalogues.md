# Updating Prices on Catalogues

Pricing on [Custom Catalogues](CreatingaCustomCatalogue.md) can be edited at three levels:

- **Item level** - Any item (collection item or standalone item) can have custom prices defined by entering the amount in the price text input. Depending on the Service, the available billing models  (for example, /hr, /mo, etc.) will be displayed. This option is available for [Default Services](docs/Administration/ServicesManagement/Working%20with%20Default%20Services/Overview.md) as well.
- **Collection level** - All collections in a catalogue have an option to bulk-update prices for all Collection Items in that Collection by specifying a multiplier (< 1 for deflation and > 1 for inflation).
- **Service level** - All services in a catalogue have an option to bulk-update prices for that Service by specifying a multiplier (< 1 for deflation and > 1 for inflation).

:::note
All changes need to be published in order to reflect on the Apiculus Cloud Console. If a customer is on a resource creation/purchase page at the time of publishing these edits, their purchase will fail.
